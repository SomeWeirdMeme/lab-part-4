31.in code......
32.Yes it does if anything went wronf you could see the display val and left oper to see exactly where u failed.
33.I mean its a little too much, it has several lines for just simple single int math and i cant imagine with double digits or more than 2 calculations.
remove applyprevOPer.
34.Advantages; are that it helps u understand the logic, no extra code n stuff safer. Disadvantages; takes some time for harder programs.
easy to mess up, you cant see the runtime or side effects. and for print statments ads are shows the runtime, quick to implement and helps spot smaller bugs. dis; clutters easy, 
requires multiple runs usually and not helpful for more advanced code. IE more outputs n stuff.
